## üìù How to Play

### Game Objective
Be the last player with cards remaining by out-bluffing and outsmarting your opponents!

### Setup
- Join or create a room. The host sets the hand size and turn timer.
- Each player is dealt a hand of cards (face down to others).

### Turn Flow
1. **Declare a Hand:** On your turn, select cards and declare a poker hand (e.g., Pair, Two Pair, Straight, etc.). You may bluff and claim a stronger hand than you actually have.
2. **Next Player:** The next player (clockwise) must declare a hand of equal or greater strength, or call bluff.
3. **Calling Bluff:** Any player (on their turn) can call bluff instead of declaring a hand.

### Bluff Resolution
- If a bluff is called, all cards are revealed:
  - **If the claimed hand exists:** The caller loses a card.
  - **If the claim was a bluff:** The claimer loses a card.
- The next round starts with the player after the loser (skipping eliminated players).

### Elimination & Victory
- Players with 0 cards are eliminated and cannot play or call bluff (they can spectate).
- The last player with cards wins the game!

### Additional Rules
- Hands must always increase in strength (or match the previous hand's strength with higher kickers).
- All hand types and comparisons follow standard poker rules (with robust kicker logic).
- The turn timer enforces play speed; if time runs out, the player is skipped.
- Eliminated players are visually marked and cannot interact.
